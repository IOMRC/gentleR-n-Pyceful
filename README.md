# gentleR-n-Pyceful

Welcome to the repository for the gentleR-n-Pyceful weekly discussion group about data analysis and visualisation in the Python and R programming languages.

We meet every Tuesday from 10:30-11:30 in the Woodside Oceanworks Space on floor one of the UWA IOMRC building. This group embraces those who are just starting on their R or Python programming journey to those who have been on this path for a while. We discuss topics of interest and frustrations, show each other cool projects we have been working on, give each other advice and share generally useful coding related information. 

The format of our weekly meetings will likely evolve, but at present the first 10-15 mins are for people to introduction themselves, share what they have been (or are interested in) working on in R and/or Python and then nominate a topic they would like to discuss. These topics are noted on a whiteboard and the group decides on the discussion topic and facilitator for the following week. Under the gracious guidance of the facilitator, the bulk of the meeting (i.e. 30-40 min) is then dedicated to the discussion topic selected in the previous meeting (check the issue tracker in the repository to see next week’s meeting topic). The last 10-15 mins of the meeting are for general questions, comments and contributions after the topic discussion. 

If you would like to join the groups repository and receive updates on future discussion topics (and other bits of information like handy links) then please get in touch with any of the people listed in the IOMRC github account (whether it’s an email or just bumping into people in the corridor) with your github username and they can invite you to join. 

So, bring your code, coffee (or tea) cup and/or some cake and nibbles (if you feel the urge!) for some friendly and informal discussions about the group’s latest topics of interest.
